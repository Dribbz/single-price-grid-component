## Overview

The challenge provided a template text and a design to replicate.
I started with creating the elements and grouping necessary elements together , decided to go with the mobile design first as it's the best practice then i added media query to adjust the design to desktop view

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action
